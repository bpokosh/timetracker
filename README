Time tracker is a simple app for managing time log entries.

== Customers
Customers can be view, created, edited, and deleted from the Customers tab. Clicking the 'Report' link next to each Customer will display more information about that Customer and all logged Time Entries.

== Projects
Projects can be created and deleted from the Projects tab. Each project is associated with a single Customer. Projects allow Time Entries to be grouped together and organized for a Customer.

== Time Log
The Time Log is where new Time Entries are recorded. Each Time Entry is associated with a single Employee and a single Project. The start and end time can be entered manually and the duration will be calculated for you. A short description can be entered for each entry. Time Entries can be exported as CSV by clicking the 'Export' link at the bottom of the Time Log.
